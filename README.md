# npn-robdd-crypto
This codebase utilizes CUDD and SageMath to find the lowest possible ROBDD size across variable orderings of n-variable NPN classes, paired with the cryptographic properties of the classes. 

The NPN classes must be supplied. They can be found at \cite(pa-npn). 

Requirements: 
SageMath xxx
CUDD xxx -> specifically dd library cython cudd
Python
C?
